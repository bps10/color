1. Lights - We adopt the primaries used by WD Wright [r: 650.0nm, g: 530nm, b: 460nm].  As an alternative option we also include those used by Stockman [r: 645nm, g: 526nm, s: 444nm].

2. Protanope\Deuteranope confusion lines - We again adopt the values of WD Wright and assume a Protanope and a Deuteranope spectral neutral point of 495.5nm, 500nm, respectively. Through interpolation we can find the copunctual points for both of these viewers.
